## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Bharat Herald, a legacy newspaper with a 70-year history, is facing a severe crisis. Print circulation has dropped by over **50% (2019–2024)**. The company’s **2021 digital pilot failed**, and it is now on the brink of bankruptcy.  

My task, as the data analyst **Peter Pandey**, was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the company’s operational and financial data to diagnose the root causes of this decline.

## 💡 Key Findings & Hypotheses  

My analysis of the data revealed a powerful and counter-intuitive story: the company’s crisis was not simply a revenue problem but a story of a dying business model and a failure of strategic adaptation.

Key findings proved the following hypotheses:

- **Lost the “Digital Land Grab”**  
  While the market was rapidly shifting to digital (supported by rising internet penetration in key markets), Bharat Herald failed to capture this new audience, allowing faster competitors to dominate.

- **War on Two Fronts**  
  The company was simultaneously “losing the traditional land” (older print audience decline) while failing to compete in the digital world.

- **Dangerous Decoupling of Revenue and Circulation**  
  Readership collapsed, but advertisers were charged more to survive — a classic, unsustainable model of a dying platform.

- **Self-Inflicted Wound**  
  Cost data revealed the “digital strategy” was not a sustained effort but a one-year experiment that was quickly abandoned.
