Problem Statement
Bharat Herald, a legacy newspaper with a 70-year history, is facing a severe crisis. Print circulation has dropped by over 50% from 2019 to 2024. The company's 2021 digital pilot failed, and it is now on the brink of bankruptcy. My task, as the data analyst Peter Pandey, was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's operational and financial data to diagnose the root causes of this decline.

Key Findings & Hypotheses
My analysis of the data revealed a surprising and powerful story. The company's crisis was not a simple revenue problem, but a story of a dying business model.

My key findings proved the following hypotheses:

The company lost the "digital land grab." While the market was rapidly shifting to digital (proven by rising internet penetration), the company failed to capture this new audience, allowing faster competitors to dominate.

The company was fighting a war on two fronts. It was simultaneously "losing the traditional land" as its older print audience declined, and it failed to compete in the new digital world.

The final, most critical finding was the decoupling of revenue and circulation. The data showed that readership was collapsing, but the company was charging its remaining advertisers more money just to survive. This is the classic, unsustainable financial model of a dying platform.
